gettingandcleaningdata repository
===
This repository contains the raw text data files of movement
data gathered by Samsung smartphones.  These data files were processed
to create tidy data frames required for the Getting and Cleaning Data
course project.  The repository also contains the run_analysis.R script
file used to create the tidy data frames and the text files containing
the tidy data.  Finally the repository contains a codebook that describes
the original data sets and the tidy data sets.
